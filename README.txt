This database was created for university task. It's describe structure of
drilling expedition, but I don't have any real examples. So whole database is
only my imagination and a little bit of information from wikipedia.

For this base i wrote some procedures, functions and triggers. I made almost all
kinds of queries that I knew, but they are not so huge because it's only for study.
All names and titles are knocked out, and coincidences are random.
Database schema attached.
